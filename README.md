## About Me

Hi! My name is Nick and I'm a full-stack software engineer from Southern California. I love building things from scratch, and solving the problems that come with it. I recently finished the Learning Fuze full-immersion coding bootcamp and am actively seeking employment opportunities for software engineering! 

Outside of coding, I'm a musician ü•Å and a cat dad üêà
